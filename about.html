        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started my professional career studying the engineering in Digital Systems and Robotics at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, campus state of México. 
            During my Bachelor studies, I enrolled on different research groups of robotics such as the CEM robot research and development group and the Quantum Robotics team.
            Then, I began to focus my interests on artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning and I started the Master in Computer Science.
        Here, I worked with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy signal analysis, focusing on reconstruction methods. I am currently a PhD student at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, working with Gravitational Wave signals from the 
        LIGO Scientific Collaboration.</p><br>
    
        <p>Outside academic interests, I enjoy workout and listen to music. I spend time consuming science communicators such as carl sagan and michu kaku. Science fiction is another of my favorite lirerary genre!</p>
